### Chat Client-Server Application Presentation

#### Introduction:
Greetings! I'm excited to introduce a simple chat client application developed in Java. This application allows users to exchange messages in a chat-like interface with real-time updates. The application features a sleek design and utilizes Java's `Socket` for networking.

#### Key Features:

1. **User Interface:**
   - The interface is designed with a clean and modern look, featuring user avatars, message bubbles, and real-time timestamps for messages.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Users can send and receive messages in a chat-like format.
   - The application provides a "typing..." indicator when the user is typing a message.

3. **Exit and New Tab Options:**
   - Users can exit the application using the "Exit" button, providing a clean and efficient way to terminate the client.
   - The "New Tab" button allows users to open a new chat tab, facilitating multiple chat sessions.

4. **Styling and Layout:**
   - Attention to aesthetics with color-coordinated buttons and layout management for an organized user experience.

#### Usage:

1. **Launching the Application:**
   - Upon execution, the chat client window appears with a user interface featuring user avatars, message bubbles, and real-time timestamps.

2. **Exiting the Application:**
   - Clicking the "Exit" button (labeled as "USER 2") closes the chat client, providing a convenient way for users to exit the application.

3. **New Tab Option:**
   - Clicking the "New Tab" button opens a new chat tab, allowing users to manage multiple chat sessions concurrently.

4. **Sending Messages:**
   - Users can type messages in the input field and click the "Send" button to send messages to the chat.

#### Real-Time Updates:

1. **Message Formatting:**
   - Messages are formatted with a green background, providing a visually appealing and easy-to-read interface.

2. **Timestamps:**
   - Messages include real-time timestamps, enhancing the user experience by providing context for when each message was sent.

#### Networking:

1. **Socket Communication:**
   - The application utilizes Java's `Socket` for network communication, allowing seamless data exchange between the client and the server.

2. **Data Streams:**
   - Data streams (`DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream`) enable the transmission of messages between the client and the server.

#### Conclusion:

In conclusion, this Java-based chat client application showcases an elegant and user-friendly design while leveraging Java's networking capabilities for real-time communication. It provides users with a simple yet effective platform for exchanging messages. I'm ready to address any questions or discuss further details about this project. Thank you for your time and attention.
